## Prerequisites

This starter requires a [BigCommerce sandbox](https://start.bigcommerce.com/developer-sandbox/) or a [production store provisioned to run a headless storefront](https://www.bigcommerce.com/solutions/multi-store/).

To get started, use this README and the [example environment variable comments](https://github.com/bigcommerce/nextjs-commerce/blob/main/.env.example).

## Develop locally

Clone the template repo manually and supply the environment variables [defined in .env.example](https://github.com/bigcommerce/nextjs-commerce/blob/main/.env.example). The best practice is to use [Vercel environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: Do not commit your `.env` file. It exposes secrets that allow others to control your BigCommerce store.

- Install the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```
- Link your local instance with the desired Vercel and GitHub accounts. This action creates a `.vercel` directory:

```bash
vercel link
```

- Download the [Vercel environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables):

```bash
vercel env pull
```

- Install the app's default dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The app runs on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Configure checkout

## Get to know the BigCommerce GraphQL Storefront API

In addition to being compatible with BigCommerce's multi-storefront features, this starter uses the [GraphQL Storefront API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/storefront/graphql/graphql-api-overview). This API makes it possible for merchants to control the representation of products and categories, carts, orders, customer segmentation, and more. To get a sense of what is possible to do directly on the storefront, check out the [GraphQL Playground](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/graphql-storefront/playground).

When you access the Playground through the store control panel, BigCommerce provides a valid GraphQL Storefront authentication token without any additional API calls on your part. To access the dedicated GraphQL Playground for a particular sandbox or store, sign in to its BigCommerce account and navigate to **[Settings > API](https://login.bigcommerce.com/deep-links/manage/settings-list)**, then click **Storefront API Playground**.
